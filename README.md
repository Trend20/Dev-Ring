# Dev Ring

`Dev Ring` is an open-source web application platform that ranks developers based on their projects' activity and impact. 
It aims to provide a centralized platform for developers `to track and showcase their work`, `collaborate with others`, `compare themselves to top developers` and `gain recognition within the developer community`.

This platform can also be used by `employers` to easily find `developers` who best suits their companies.
